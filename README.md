# FutureCloud [![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/FutureCloud)](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/FutureCloud)
This project is a completly nodeJS based file server like nextcloud or SeaFile.  
It may not be as secure as the proven Applications which were created by experienced Developers, but it is based on modern languages and not that rusty old stuff like PHP.  
  
![This is an absolute win](https://media1.tenor.com/images/c4bb9246ba107ea847f4bb66b6e0a99c/tenor.gif?itemid=15135962)
  
### redoing stuff
  
  ## TODO:
  - [ ] option to encrypt the Files
  - [ ] Hash Passwords
  - [ ] Rename Option
  - [ ] Folders for the Userinterface
  - [ ] Enable the "filesharing" option
  - [ ] Smoother Interface
  - [ ] Revisit some older functions that can be improved (like the deletion of Files (use splice?)) => find out if splice is actually more performant (likely but not sure)
  - [ ] Maybe add Register ?
  - [ ] Switch to a real DB for better performance
   
  
##### Also i will rewrite this in typescript for [deno](https://deno.land/) at some point (that's the plan at least)
