# FutureCloud [![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/FutureCloud)](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/FutureCloud)
This project is a file server like nextcloud or SeaFile and is built in Javascript.  
It originated in my desire for a simple yet capable file server, which can act as an internal NAS and external file sharing service.  
File sharing is not a dedicated feature yet, but you can create accounts solely meant for public file sharing. That way everything is still password protected.  
Development on this project has somewhat come to a standstill, as i personally (and with that it's sole user) have not used it that much any more and other projects got more interesting. I may pick this Project back up, but that is unlikely. If i do, i will unarchive the repository.  
  ## TODO:
  - [ ] Automated testing
  - [ ] Hash Passwords
  - [ ] Option to encrypt the Files
